## Overview
This project is for me to understand the fundamentals of **Spring MVC**, an essential web framework for Java developers who work on enterprise-level projects. I use controllers, models and views (hence MVC) to build an e-commerce website for athletes. I explore techinques for exception handling, themes, implementing asynchronous execution flows, and extending the Spring MVC application to serve REST requests.
